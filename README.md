# Logos and images for _Project Azide_

[Azide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azide) is a chemical compound, consisting of 3 nitrogen atoms in a linear structure, connected by double bonds.

To be clear: the actual chemical azide has absolutely nothing to do with our _Project Azide_ display; it's just a codename.

Azide's chemical formula is N<sub>3</sub>, thus our abbreviation for _Project Azide_ is __PN3__

Our logo is inspired by the diagram of azide's structure:
### N=N=N
(Those are double bonds, not equal signs, between the nitrogen atoms.)

That said, azide is a fascinating and incredibly powerful explosive:
