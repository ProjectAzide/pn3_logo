# Logos and images for _Project Azide_

[Azide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azide) is a chemical compound, consisting of three nitrogen atoms in a linear structure, connected by double bonds.

To be perfectly clear: _Project Azide_ does not use the actual chemical azide in any way; it's just our [code name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_name#Project_code_name).

Azide's chemical formula is N<sub>3</sub>, hence the official abbreviation of _Project Azide_ is __PN3__

Our logo is inspired by a diagram of azide's linear structure:
### N=N=N
(Those are double bonds, not equal signs, between the three nitrogen atoms.)

All that said, azide is a fascinating (and incredibly powerful) substance:
